## How to write a blog post!

* Name this file `yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-post.md` e.g. `2013-04-15-Space-Apps-London.md`
* Add this header to the top of the file
```
   ---
   layout: post
   title: Name of Post

   feature-img: "img/sample_feature_img.png" # Note if you donâ€™t want a header image, delete this line

```
* Run Jekyll to locally test
	* On your first time running Jekyll run: `bundle install` to get Ruby dependencies
	* `bundle exec jekyll serve`
	* Browse to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)
* Once happy with your post, commit the changes
	* `git add <blog_file>` i.e. `git add _posts/2013-04-15-Space-Apps-London.md`

	*  This should make them go live immediately if you commit directly to the repo
		* (Or if you submit a pull request - changes should go live after the pull request is accepted!)
* If problems occur, look at the output and build status on Travis CI, as well as the output from the local Jekyll server
	* GitHub may send your email or info@hacksocnotts.co.uk with failure information (although it's not always very helpful)
	* Ask @jay-to-the-dee (Dilks) or @jamietanna if you're still stuck :)
