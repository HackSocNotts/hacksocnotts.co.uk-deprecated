It's been a fantastic year for HackSoc. We've done so many things and had a great time! The elections are now complete and it's time to hand over to a new committee...

### Summary of the year
We've done alot this year, including attending many hackathons, running many tech talks from members and guests and engaging with the wider community. In summary we have done the following:

+ _Fresher's Fayre (2x) and Employability Street_: We attended freshers fair twice and an employability fair put on by the University in order to show people at university what we do as a society.
+ _TechFest (2x)_: We ran two hybrid conference style events with tech talks and Pizza in order to engage with our members and see what sort of events they wanted us to put on this year.
+ _TechNottingham (many)_: We went to the monthly tech meetups with members of the nottingham tech community. 
+ _Intro to Python sessions (many)_: We ran very successful introduction to programming sessions which taught non-programmers the basics of Python.
+ _TechTalks (from members and guests)_: We had talks from Goldman Sachs, Esendex, LifeSciences and many talks from members of the society on topics ranging from [Git](https://github.com/jamietanna/gittalk15), [the use of Microframeworks](https://github.com/sdh100shaun/hacksoc-microframeworks) to [DataMining with Spark](https://github.com/lukeg101/Talks/blob/master/IntroToScalaAndSparkTalk.pdf).
+ _HackNotts and WiT!_: Not to forget the elephant in the room, we ran 2 very successful events in the form of a large Hackathon [HackNotts](http://hacknotts.com/) and the [Women In Technology conference](http://2016.inspirewit.com/).

### What does it all mean?
 
+ _Record Member numbers:_ HackSoc has had the largest intake so far with 172\* members! This is the most the society has ever had. We are now regarded as a _large_ society in the grand scheme of the students union, this is fantastic and we will definitely be doing more stuff with the University in the future.
+ _Low attrition rates:_ We have also had the lowest attrition rates so far for the regular events we run (including the tech [talks](https://github.com/lukeg101/Talks) and guest speakers) which is fantastic. On average we have had 15 people at each regular event, with record highs in the first 2 weeks and moreso around special events such as _HackNotts_ and _Women In Technology_.
+ _Engaging with the Real World:_ As a society we began to engage more with the local technology community which is something we didn't real do before. This involved going to the monthly meetups with [TechNottingham](http://www.technottingham.com/) and also specific events including _mobileNotts_ and _Hack24_ (next week). This was an important goal of mine as I wanted to build the community both within the university and expand it to the wider one.
+ _Spread the love:_ This has been the second year that [MLH](https://www.mlh.io) has existed in the EU and HackSoc has been to many of the hackathons this year, including BrumHack, HackLondon, Hack The Holidays, StudentHack, HackCambridge and of course running HackNotts! As a result, we came 6th in the MLH EU [standings](https://mlh.io/standings/f2015-eu) for the fall season. This is great for a society of our size and shows that we definitely deserve our place in the hacking community!
+ _Address all the issues!_: This year we have been quite successful with some of the events we have run which have aimed to address some of the important issues in the tech industry and further afield. Notably, We ran an MLH [Local Hack Day](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) here at the university which was an attempt to dispell myths about hacking and allow people from all over the east midlands to have a go at hacking and [Women in Technology](http://2016.inspirewit.com/) which aimed to discuss the issues surrounding the repesentation of Women in the Tech industry.

\*This is accurate as of _10/03/2016_

### Constititution Changes

We've also voted on some changes to the constitution, these include:

+ Some old roles have been removed, including _Corporate Relations_, _Web Secretary_ and _Equipment Secretary_.
+ New roles have been proposed including, _Outreach and Inclusivity Secretary_ & _Infrastructure Secretary_.
+ The responsibilities of _Corporate relations_ have been merged into the role of _President_.
+ Amendments to the role of _Hack Secretary_ include the addition of the responsibility of organising _HackNotts_. This change has been changed to reflect recent changes of responsibility throughout the year.
+ Clause 1.14 has been modified to change the conditions upon which a member of the society may run for the role of President in the elections. More specifically, to be elegible to run as the President of the society, a candidate must _either_ be a former member of the committee _or_ have attended 3 national hackathons and the current presidential candidate is running _unnopposed_.
+ Name Change for the role of _Graphics and Publications_ to _Graphics and Publications Secretary_.

The new constitution can be found [here](https://github.com/HackSocNotts/constitution/blob/master/hacksocConstitution-09-03-2016.pdf)
